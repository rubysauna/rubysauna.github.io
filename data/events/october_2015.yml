intro: |
  Ruby Sauna invites the interested web developer and seasoned Rubyist in
  northern Europe and Scandinavia alike. People new to the language will hopefully whet their
  appetite on a great ecosystem, while developers already working
  with Ruby will have a chance to meet like–minded people and listen to talks on
  interesting subjects.

    name: Lucas Dohmen
    title: Consultant at innoQ
    topic: "Codegolfing"
    bio: |
      Codegolfing is an interesting sport: You try to write a program in the fewest characters necessary. Do you want to ship this code to production somewhere? Probably not, but just by trying this exercise you will learn a lot about your favorite programming language. You will also be surprised by how much you can do in just a few lines of code while the constraints will stimulate your productivity. Ruby is surprisingly good for golfing due to its Perl heritage.

      In this talk I will tell you a bit more about code golfing and then dive into some code I have golfed. I will show you some tricks I learned and how the desire to shave off a few more characters every time leads to new features in your tiny program that you thought would not fit in such a tiny program.
